# Lab 3: (2:00 - 3:00) - Box Model in CSS

## Objective:
Experiment with the CSS box model by adjusting padding, border, and margin.

## Task (10 minutes):
1. Add a `<div>` element to your `index.html` file with the text <br>

        ```
        "This is a box."

        ```
2. In the `styles.css` file, apply the following styles to the `<div>`

    ```css
        div {
        width: 100px;
        height: 50px;
        padding: 10px;
        border: 1px solid black;
        margin: 0;
        }
    ```

3. Set a width of `300px` and a height of `150px`.
4. Apply a `10px` padding inside the box and a `2px solid` border around it.
5. Set the margin to `20px` so that the box is spaced from the surrounding content.


## Test the Changes:

Save the `styles.css` file.
Refresh the browser with your `index.html` file and observe the box. It should now have a specific width, height, padding, border, and margin applied.
