# Lab 2: (1:00 - 2:00) - Basic Styling and Selectors

## Objective:
Apply styles to specific HTML elements using CSS selectors.

## Task (10 minutes):
1. Update styles.css:
- Open your styles.css file and add the following styles:

    ```css
        /* Change the font family of all text */
        body {
        font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
        }

        /* Style the <p> tag */
        p {
        font-size: 18px;
        line-height: 1.5;
        }

        /* Apply a margin to the <h1> tag */
        h1 {
        margin: 20px;
        }
    ```

2. Test the Changes:
Save the styles.css file.
Refresh the browser with your `index.html` file to see the changes:
- The font for the entire page should now be `Arial, sans-serif`.
- The `<p>` element should have a font size of `18px` and line height of `1.5.`
- The `<h1>` element should have a margin of 20px around it.


## Outcome:
By the end of this lab, you will have:

- Applied global styles to all text using the body selector.
- Styled the `<p>` tag by adjusting its font size and line height.
- Added a margin to the `<h1>` element to control its spacing.
